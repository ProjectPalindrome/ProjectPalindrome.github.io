Project Palindrome is a collective movement dedicated to the ongoing advancement of content creation for the modern web.

The strange name you see above `projectpalindrome.github.io` is a requirement necessary when you're designing your first GitHub Page.

As the development of the website continues to grow, feel free to refer to our documentation on our wiki, or our source code for reference.

## What is it built on?

At the moment, we are writing the site on plain HTML, CSS and Javascript - but we will later design the website using the following tech stack.

Technology | Name | Note
-----------|------|-------------
Content Management System | {cms} | {cmsDescription}
Front-End Framework | {frameworkName} | {frameworkDescription}
Server | Netlify | A multi-cloud server and the company responsible for the JAMstack movement
